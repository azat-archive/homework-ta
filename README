Static analyzer for Diffusion Equation

1. Compilation

1.1. *nix:
	g++ -o dists/out base/Exception.cpp main.cpp models/Analyzer.cpp models/Coloring.cpp models/Diff.cpp
1.2. Windows:
	g++ -o dists\out.exe base\ExceptionWin.cpp main.cpp models\Analyzer.cpp models\ColoringWin.cpp models\Diff.cpp
1.3. Windows (libs build in):
	g++ -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc -o dists\out.exe base\ExceptionWin.cpp main.cpp models\Analyzer.cpp models\ColoringWin.cpp models\Diff.cpp
1.4. Arm (libs build in):
	arm-linux-gnueabi-g++ -static-libgcc -o dists/out_arm base/Exception.cpp main.cpp models/Analyzer.cpp models/Coloring.cpp models/Diff.cpp

Difference between 1.2 and 1.3 is: 1.2 - worked only on windows, where installed MinGW, and 1.3 worked on any compatible windows system (libraries build in binary file)

The binary file is in "out"

2. Debug
	2.1. File "main.h"

3. E.t.c.
	3.1 Model Diff is not realy need in this project (write it firstly - and then don`t wont delete)
